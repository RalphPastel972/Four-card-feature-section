## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Self-assessment

#### What I learnt

I used grid for the first time.
I played a fair bit with grid to understand the fundamentals.

#### What I am proud of

Not much. I took way too long for such a simple result.

#### What I would do differently

n/a

#### Challenges

I was not sure th best option to place the tiles between 2 lines.

#### Help needed

n/a

#### Continued development

I'm planning on working a lot on grid so it becomes as intuitive as flex became to me.
